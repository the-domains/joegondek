<h1>My Demand Generation Catharsis</h1><p>As I was cleaning up old emails, I realized that every other one I was receiving was coming from someone's demand generation program. As I stopped and read some of the subject lines, I realized how numb I had become to receiving them. I also started to realize how I was conditioned to delete them without fixing the root problem. As this epiphany consumed me, I wanted to dig deeper. I made the decision to unsubscribe from every email that gave me the option to.</p><p><strong>The Dark Alley of Emails and Landing Pages</strong></p><p>When you take a moment to look at the pages after hitting ‘unsubscribe’, you feel like you are being transported to a seedy world of bad design and usability efforts. The content on the page lacks any warmth. Match that with the design of a template page in a demand generation engine that has all the design and grace of a faded billboard on a strip on a two-lane highway in any rural town.</p><p>I hoped that I would end up on one landing page from the unsubscribe button that made me want to keep getting emails. It never happened. At best, some offered me a chance to unsubscribe from all of the email lists I hade unwittingly been a part of. I would land on a page and see a whole line of checked boxes and just be amazed with the wonderment of some pivotal scene in a science fiction movie and asking myself, ”But…But…How was I attached to all of these email lists???”</p><p><strong>People Are Waking Up!</strong></p><p>As others before me have to this Neo-like realization of the demand generation, inevitably there will be a tipping point where people will come out the passive acceptance as we see certain countries taking hold of this inefficiency and the wasted hours that go into skimming through useless emails.</p><p><strong>The Masses Are Rising Up Against The Machines!</strong></p><p>People are getting more informed digitally every day. You are going to do more damage to your brand by sending out a bad message, or group of messages without the ‘human touch’. Here are a few guidelines to follow that may help “humanize” your efforts.</p><p><strong>1. Know your contact list like you would know who is coming to your wedding.</strong></p><p>If you don’t know a lot about whom you are advertising to, how successful can you be? Unless you are an edgy comedian, you may not be able to handle the risk of offending a small portion of your audience. Put the time into looking at your contacts, know how they are segmented and create a unique value proposition that others with a shotgun process for email can’t compete with. Purchased email lists or services can work, but make sure you are getting what you paid for. The wrong message targeted to a list can do brand damage in one email send.</p><p><strong>2. It’s okay to be human. Really.</strong></p><p>If social media has taught us anything, it should be that the thoughts and opinions of like-minded individuals and peers have the most powerful message. Why shouldn't your email be any different? If you can use what you know about somebody to add some emotion to it, is there any downside to that? More importantly, maybe you have some contacts that you don’t know as much as you want to about them. Is it wrong to admit you need more information to help speak to them better? Have you ever started talking to someone and for the life of you cannot remember his or her name? What happens? You can be honest, ask for their name and instantly be in a deeper level of engagement. What happens if you don’t ask them? It never fails when I have forgotten someone’s name that someone will come along forcing me into an awkward introduction.</p><p><strong>3. Is it really that difficult to design a nice email and landing page?</strong></p><p>Look at any line-item budget for companies for web design and the investments made in marketing automation and demand generation platforms. If you are lucky, you might see this teeny-tiny line item for the budget for content and design for emails and landing pages. Your contacts are the people you already have invested an enormous amount of money to acquire. Why would you not spend extra money to hold onto to them? Is it really that difficult or expensive to add a<em>thoughtful</em>stock image to an email? Of the millions of images available, is it hard to pick one that connects on some emotional level with your audience? People manage to create beautiful, thoughtful insights or calls to action in 144 characters. I bet there are more successful social media stars that spend more time on a tweet than the average email campaign copy that goes out.</p><p><strong>4. Treat your contacts like your best friends.</strong></p><p>Think about how much it costs you to get a lead. Now multiply that by how many emails you are about to send out. With the emphasis on allowing people an easy way to opt-out of every email, make sure you are doing everything in your power to hold onto them. Sometimes you get into a fight with the people you care about. That person starts to walk away and you don’t wan them to. You call out their name. They stop and turn around. You have to say and do something that makes them stay. This is another big movie scene. Is this the moment when you say, ”Here is a list of checkboxes. Let me know whether I talked too much or you changed jobs.”</p><p><strong>You Have Been Warned, Digital Marketers.</strong></p><p>So take heed demand generation pioneers and marketing automation gurus. If you and your businesses even want a fraction of the attention I afford my colleagues and peers, it is time to step up your game. You can try to entice me with your white papers, but that won’t be enough anymore. I have awakened from my slumber, and I am sure others won’t be far behind.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"> </a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
